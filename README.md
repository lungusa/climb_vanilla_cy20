page wrapper name:
Fight For Air Climb - CY20 (AK)
version: v02. CY20 Redesign Draft

this is for events that don't necessarily fall within the categories of events that are established, regular events, like walks, climbs, cycle.
This is a general platform, which is why it has been called 'vanilla'. (ironically this tends to be for "special" events out of the ordinary).

canvas? no. there's something called canvas.
blank slate? slate?
maybe vanilla is best.
